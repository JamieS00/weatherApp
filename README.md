## **Overview**

This project is a web application that allows users to search weather conditions for any city, displaying current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a seven-day forecast using data from a provided weather API. The user-friendly interface includes intuitive error handlingâ€”if an invalid city name is entered, the app remains static, signaling to users to enter a valid city without reloading the page. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during the SheCodes bootcamp, this project demonstrates my ability to integrate APIs and create interactive, responsive applications.

## **Features**

- Search Functionality: Users can enter any city name to retrieve current weather conditions and a weekly forecast.
- Weather Data Display: Shows the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the forecast for the next week based on data from the provided API.
- Error Handling: When an invalid city name (e.g., random letters) is entered, the page remains static, and no new weather data is displayed, indicating the need for a valid input without reloading the page.
